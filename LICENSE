# DebugPrint

DebugPrint is a simple tool that provides two static methods for printing messages. The first method is a regular print function, and the second method is a debug print function that only runs if the application is in developer mode. This allows you to use `debugPrint()` in development without affecting the production environment.

## Features

- Regular print method
- Debug print method that checks the application's mode

## Usage

```python
from debug_print import DebugPrint

# Regular print
DebugPrint.print("This is a regular print message.")

# Debug print (only prints in developer mode)
DebugPrint.debugPrint("This is a debug print message.")
```
