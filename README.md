# DebugPrint

DebugPrint is a simple tool that provides two static methods for printing messages:

1. **print()**: A regular print function.
2. **debugPrint()**: A debug print function that only runs if the application is in developer mode.

This allows you to use `debugPrint()` in development without affecting the production environment.
